                        <p>This was my first and only internship I participated in during my time at Olemiss.I worked there as
                            a Data Analyst and we would recieve <br>assignments from mentors weekly to monitor
                            online conversations. We worked using <span class="colored-letters">Python</span>, <span class="colored-letters">MYSQL</span>, and <span class="colored-letters">Pandas</span>.<br>
                            The reason I waited a while to intern during college is that the freshmen year of college is when covid hit .<br>
                            It happned right before we got away for summer and lasted well into my sophmore year.
                            <br> By the time senior year came around, this was all I could get with the little<br> time I had left, and 
                            I am proud to of been selected for it.

                            only other<br> help I had for the project was voice acting roles and guidance from my sponsor.
                            <br>This is the first and only video game I created, I wanted to try<br>
                            doing something new that I havent done before, <br>
